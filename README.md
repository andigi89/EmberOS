# EmberOS
EmberOS a new way to FreeBSD

Why Ember OS?
Many users and especially newbies in the BSD universe want a good start with FreeBSD. But most of us know that FreeBSD doesn't provide a GUI-installer. This causes a high lack of a user-friendly OS.

Therefore the team of Ember OS want to open the doors to FreeBSD with a re-freshing mind and approach!

Our mission
- providing a lightweight FreeBSD with GUI-installer
- pre-installed-tools to navigate easily (e.g. Welcome-Greeter, Tips&Tricks, First things first, YouTube-Videos, wiki)
- customize with EmberOS easily your FreeBSD - a unique OS for your needs! 
- WE LISTEN TO YOUR NEEDS! - Let us talk and discuss in forum, Telegram, Matrix, GitHub or a Video-Sessions Q+A
- Update-helper, dsbmd(gui automount) pre-installed with desktop

Roadmap
EmberOS will be a project created and maintained in our spare time. New contributors are welcomed in almost all sections

FAQ
1. When will be the first EmberOS.iso? - Patience is the key :-)  
2. How can we stay informed on the progress of EmberOS? - Forum, Telegram, GitHub, homepage

Thanks to all new interested users and upcoming contributors to EmberOS! 

Let us make EmberOS a bigger and greater star for our BSD world! There is so much to discover! Join our journey! NOW!
